## Inspiration
My inspiration for this project stemmed from the problem, which was to make something that can help students. As a student myself, one of my biggest challenges is working on a schedule, since I often procrastinate and even when I study it is hard to focus.
## What it does
This project helps with focus, using a routine set by the user, they can be immersed in their studies with timed breaks. We also keep things like music in the app, to keep the user from getting sidetracked.
## How we built it
I built this project using the Flask framework for the backend. ChatGPT was used for inspiration, troubleshooting, styling, and some scripting.
## Challenges we ran into
I had some troubles with the timer, but I was able to resolve them fairly quickly.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of how this project created a great tool for students to use.
## What we learned
I learnt how to evolve the project, as it just started out as a simple timer and became a full study planner.
## What's next for StudyNest
StudyNest could benefit from a mobile port of the app, as many users will want to use it in places without a computer.
